# monthly-report-generator
Python code to generate consolidated monthly reports (also practice with modularizing code)

Each month I receive a word document from each of my direct reports that I need to consolidate into a single word document (with common formatting, bulleted, etc). Normally this involves manual copying and pasting, so I wrote a Python code to do this for me.
